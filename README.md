# first-ever-easy-lean-assignment
this is just a test assignment - and by the way it's easy

and this is the readme file - amazing you are actually reading the readme... hello.. you can stop reading now

I think what you have to do is

1. open the .lean file

2. fix the code

3. commit the changes
4. maybe you have to push the commit
5.
